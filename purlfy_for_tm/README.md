# pURLfy for Tampermonkey

<!-- TODO: Badges -->

The ultimate URL purifier - Tampermonkey version. This script uses [pURLfy core](https://github.com/PRO-2684/pURLfy) as its core, and integrates its URL purifying functionality into a Tampermonkey script.

## Installation

Simply navigate to [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/424682-purlfy-for-tampermonkey) and click the "Install this script" button.

## How it works

### Purifying URLs

See [pURLfy core](https://github.com/PRO-2684/pURLfy) and its source code for more information.

### Hooks

This script hooks certain methods, intercepts calls to them, purifies the URLs, and then calls the original methods with the purified URLs. For more information, see the source code.
