## 🔑 Personal Access Token (PAT)

- Without a PAT, only $60$ requests per hour are allowed, and GitHub Plus won't be able to fetch extended information for private repos; with a PAT, $5000$ requests per hour are allowed, which suffices for most users, and GitHub Plus can also fetch extended information for private repos that you have access to.
- Find out how to create a fine-grained personal access token [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token).
- Simply select `All repositories` under `Repository access` section, and add read-only `Metadata` access under `Permissions` section. An example image is shown below for reference.
- Remember to *generate a new token when it expires*.
- Use a personal access token on a mirror site at your own risk.

## ❓ FAQ

- Q: Even when **↗️ Right Sidebar** is not set to `Hide Completely`, the sidebar is still hidden. How can I fix this?
    - A: Your ad-blocker or some other extension might be blocking the elements. Most notably, [this commit to `easylist`](https://github.com/easylist/easylist/commit/c1ffc815f15c78cbee9c32694acb8bd80c54fb64) has introduced the rule `github.com##.dashboard-changelog:has-text(Latest from our changelog)`, which blocks the whole section. You can try to disable the ad-blocker on GitHub or add an exception for this rule.

## 🤔 Known Issues

- The added information might not align well.
- You might see a "Error Looks like something went wrong!" banner if "Tracking Prevention" is enabled.
